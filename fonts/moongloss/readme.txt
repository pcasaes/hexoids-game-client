Moongloss was created to be a display font. A font that you would use to display the date, time, or little bits of information. There are many fonts out there that are meant for things for this, but none quite like this font.
So what is Moongloss? It's meant to fulfil the following design criteria:
1. To look reasonably futuristic, like it would feel at home in a sci-fi movie
2. To look polished and elegant. There are fonts that meet criteria 1, but fail at this regard
3. To be as monospaced as possible but still look good. Let's say you made a clock display with this font. A thin number '1' vs a fat number '8' will mess up the aesthetics of your display when minutes change and cause your entire clock to shift to the left or right. As such, numbers are strictly monospaced and are the same size in this font, but letters are variably sized to maintain an even appearance.

So Moongloss fulfils all of these criteria, but it does come with a few  caveats:
1. There are no common letters. I do have rough sketches of them but they were never developed further, in order to save time. I don't really expect that you will use them in a display oriented font.
2. This font doesn't look that great at tiny sizes. Google's Roboto font is designed to be legible at every possible size. Unfortunately it will take to long for me to implement that variability in this font. It is desgined to fulfil a specific niche of sizes (12/14pt and up)
3. Opentype was used as the font format because it scales better at small sizes. I would have liked to go Truetype but it doesn't look that good unfortunately.

Questions:
Did you have any inspiration for this font?
-I quite like the sci-fi look of Blender and the elegance of DIN. Those are my two main inspirations and I tried to take some of the design cues from each of them (e.g. the octagonal-rectangular shape of blender and the rounded smoothness of DIN)
How long did it take me to develop Moongloss?
-Approximately 3 months from start to finish
What did you use to make Moongloss?
-Inkscape for the initial glyphs and they were finished and put together in FontForge. FontForge's user interface is stuck in the stone age but oh boy is it a powerful piece of software.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to make their own font?
-You have to be obsessive about the fine details. That is the difference between a 'meh' font and an awesome font.
